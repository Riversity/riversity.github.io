I am a 3<sup>rd</sup>-year undergraduate student in the ACM Honors Class at Shanghai Jiao Tong University, majoring in Computer Science.

My research interests lie in the field of computer security, with a particular focus on secure decentralized systems. I am broadly interested in the architectures, protocols, and cryptographic foundations that ensure confidentiality and integrity. I am currently exploring methods for achieving privacy and integrity, including Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs), cryptographic techniques, oblivious data structures, and I am also interested in identifying and analyzing potential vulnerabilities and exploitations in such systems.

I have a strong academic background in these areas and have received awards in CTF competitions. Under the supervision of Prof. Guoxing Chen at SJTU, I have been conducting research on performance acceleration for TEEs and Oblivious RAMs. Currently, we are developing a framework to accelerate the loading and attestation of memory-intensive enclave applications.

I am seeking a research internship opportunity for Summer and Fall 2026. In the future, I plan to pursue a Ph.D. in Computer Science, beginning in Fall 2027.
