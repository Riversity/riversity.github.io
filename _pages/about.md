I am a 3<sup>rd</sup>-year undergraduate student at **ACM Honors Class, Shanghai Jiao Tong University** majoring in Computer Science.

My research interests lie in the field of **computer security**, with a particular focus on **secure systems** and **secure computation**.

I am broadly interested in the **architectures, protocols, and cryptographic foundations** that ensure confidentiality and integrity. I am currently exploring methods for achieving privacy and integrity, including **Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs)**, cryptographic techniques, oblivious data structures, and I am also interested in potential vulnerabilities and exploitations in such systems.

Under the supervision of [Prof. Guoxing Chen](https://donnod.github.io/) at SJTU, I have been conducting research on performance acceleration for TEEs and Oblivious RAMs. Currently, we are developing a framework to accelerate the loading and attestation of memory-intensive enclave applications.

I am seeking a research internship opportunity for Summer and Fall 2026. In the future, I plan to pursue a Ph.D. in Computer Science, beginning in Fall 2027. Please feel free to contact me if you are interested!
